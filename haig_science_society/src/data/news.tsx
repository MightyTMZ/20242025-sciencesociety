        A study by UC Davis and Stanford shows that construction materials like concrete and plastics could help trap billions of tons of CO2, reducing greenhouse gases. Concrete has the biggest potential since itâ€™s widely used, and new methods involve adding materials like biochar or carbonated aggregates. While some technologies need more testing, many are ready to use, offering a sustainable way to build and fight climate change.

        Google, Microsoft, and OpenAI are showing AI overviews provides direct answers to questions, making search more conversational. However, this technology has serious implications for online advertising because search products often summary information instead of showing them directly. For example, reduced website traffic, ad revenue loss, and legal battles over content use.
